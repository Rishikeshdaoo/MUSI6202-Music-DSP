Q.3

4:

Sampling rate - 44100 Hz
Length of Signal - Duration * Sampling rate = 44100 * 0.5 = 22050 samples

Frequency resolution = Sampling Rate/Length of Signal = 44100/22050 = 2 Hz


5:

Zero padding a signal increases the length of the signal, which results in a longer DFT. 
Longer DFT with the same Sampling rate increases the number of frequency bins, that are more closely spaced. 
So, we get a higher resolution in the frequency domain.
